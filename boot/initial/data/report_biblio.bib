   abstract = {Stock synthesis (SS) is a statistical age-structured population modeling framework that has been applied in a wide variety of fish assessments globally. The framework is highly scalable from data-weak situations where it operates as an age-structured production model, to complex situations where it can flexibly incorporate multiple data sources and account for biological and environmental processes. SS implements compensatory population dynamics through use of a function relating mean recruitment to spawner reproductive output. This function enhances the ability of SS to operate in data-weak situations and enables it to estimate fishery management quantities such as fishing rates that would provide for maximum sustainable yield and to employ these rates in forecasts of potential yield and future stock status. Complex model configurations such as multiple areas and multiple growth morphs are possible, tag-recapture data can be used to aid estimation of movement rates among areas, and most parameters can change over time in response to environmental and ecosystem factors. SS is coded using Auto-Differentiation Model Builder, so inherits its powerful capability to efficiently estimate hundreds of parameters using either maximum likelihood or Bayesian inference. Output processing, principally through a package developed in R, enables rapid model diagnosis. Details of the underlying population dynamics and the statistical framework used within SS are provided. © 2012.},

   abstract = {Stock assessment analysts are exploring an increasingly diverse and complex range of models while also facing higher expectations for consistency, documentation, and transparency in reports and management advice, all within a tight timeline. Meeting these goals requires increased efficiency at all steps in the assessment process from data processing, through model development and selection, to report writing and review. Here, we describe one widely used tool that has proven successful in increasing the efficiency of the assessment process: the r4ss package, which supports the use of the Stock Synthesis modeling framework. What began 15 years ago as a tool to provide simple model diagnostics, including plots showing data and model results, has grown into a large collection of R functions to support many aspects of the assessment process. We provide an overview of the r4ss features and illustrate its utility with examples from recent applications. Finally, we discuss lessons learned from the ongoing development of r4ss that can be applied to similar efforts associated with the next generation of stock assessment packages.},

Many decisions are required when developing integrated stock assessments. For example, the analyst needs to decide whether the model fits the data, if the optimization was successful, if estimates are consistent retrospectively, and if the model is suitable to predict future stock responses to fishing. This study provides practical guidelines for implementing selected diagnostic tools that can assist analysts in identifying problems with model specifications and alternatives that can be explored to minimize or eliminate such problems. Emphasis is placed on reviewing the implementation and interpretation of contemporary model diagnostic tools. We first describe each diagnostic approach and its utility. We then proceed by providing a “cookbook recipe” on how to implement each of the diagnostics, together with an interpretation of the results, using two worked examples of integrated stock assessments with Stock Synthesis. Further, we provide a conceptual flow chart that lays out a generic process of model development and selection using the presented model diagnostics. Based on this, we propose the following four properties as objective criteria for evaluating the plausibility of a model: (1) model convergence, (2) fit to the data, (3) model consistency, and (4) prediction skill. It would greatly benefit the stock assessment community if the next generation of stock assessment models could include the diagnostic tests presented in this study as a set of open source tools.}

I propose an approach to data weighting based on these principles.

abstract = {Somatic growth in fishes often varies through time. Despite this, most stock assessments either fix or estimate a time-invariant growth relationship because estimating time-varying growth parameters can be data intensive and subject to multiple sources of bias. Additionally, estimates of growth are often confounded with estimates of selectivity, particularly if selectivity is also time varying. Incorporating empirical weight-at-age (EWAA) information into assessments is a little-studied alternative that accounts for time-varying growth, but foregoes fixing or estimating growth and length–weight relationships. However, this method requires annual measures of fish weights at each age, and missing values must therefore be interpolated. We used Stock Synthesis in a simulation-testing framework to compare the effect of estimating a single time-invariant growth curve, time-varying growth curves, and incorporating EWAA information on management quantities and parameter estimates. We ran simulations across two fish life histories (hake-like and rockfish-like) and three data cases (data-rich, data-rich with a late-starting survey, and data-moderate). We found that when growth was time invariant, the EWAA approach was unbiased but had twice the median average relative error compared to a model that estimated growth from age and length data. However, for data-rich cases with time-varying growth, the EWAA method resulted in more accurate estimates of spawning stock biomass compared to the approach that estimated time-invariant and time-varying growth parameters, as evidenced by at least a five-fold reduction in range of median relative errors. The magnitude of this effect was greatest for the long-lived, slow-growing life history. For the relatively fast-growing species, estimates from the EWAA method were particularly sensitive to interpolating missing values.}

Steepness is a key factor characterizing the resilience of a fish stock and, hence, for establishing management reference points. This study estimates the distribution of steepness for Pacific saury using a simulation approach based on evolutionary ecology and reproductive biology, and how it changes in response to environmental change. The median estimated steepness is 0.82 (80\% probable range 0.59, 0.93) based on the best available biological information, which suggests that Pacific saury can produce a relatively high proportion of unfished recruitment when depleted to 20\% of unfished spawning biomass. Elasticity analysis indicates that steepness for Pacific saury is most sensitive to the survival rate of early life stages, mean body weight, growth, and length-at-maturity. Environmental change could substantially impact steepness, with unfavorable conditions related to survival rates, length-at-maturity, mean body weight, and growth potentially leading to a reduction in resilience. Understanding these impacts is crucial for the assessment and management of Pacific saury. Our numerical simulation approach provides an analytical tool applicable for calculating the steepness distribution in other small pelagic fish influenced by increases in sea surface temperature due to global warming.}",

However, h represents one of the most difficult parameters to estimate, even for data-rich stocks. It is usually estimated using indirect methods based on meta-analysis. Existing meta-analyses use all available estimates of h from different sources of information (i.e., from outside or within the stock assessment model) and report non-significant relationships between h and other life history traits, even though several theoretical analyses suggest the contrary. We conducted a two-stage meta-analysis, firstly selecting suitable h estimates from stock assessment models for fish stocks worldwide. 42 estimates of h were collected and several life history attributes were used as explanatory variables within generalised linear models (GLMs). We found a significant relationship (p < 0.05) between h and the ratio between length at 50% maturity (L50) and asymptotic length (L∞). The second stage of our meta-analysis was to apply this relationship to 19 fish stocks harvested off Chile to estimate species-specific h and the associated uncertainty. We discuss the assumptions of the proposed meta-analysis, the reliability of the estimated uncertainties and outline the potential application in the assessment and management of fish resources in Chile.}

abstract = {Abstract Fisheries scientists use biological models to determine sustainable fishing rates and forecast future dynamics. These models require both life-history parameters (mortality, maturity, growth) and stock-recruit parameters (juvenile production). However, there has been little research to simultaneously predict life-history and stock-recruit parameters. I develop the first data-integrated life-history model, which extends a simple model of evolutionary dynamics to field measurements of life-history parameters as well as historical records of spawning output and subsequent recruitment. This evolutionary model predicts recruitment productivity (steepness) and variability (variance and autocorrelation in recruitment deviations) as well as mortality, maturity, growth, and size, and uses these to predict intrinsic growth rate (r) for all described fishes. The model confirms previous analysis showing little correlation between steepness and either natural mortality or asymptotic maximum size (). However, it does reveal taxonomic patterns, where family Sebastidae has lower steepness () and Salmonidae has elevated steepness () relative to the prediction for bony fishes (class Actinopterygii, ). Similarly, genus Sebastes has growth rate (0.09) approaching that of several shark families (Lamniformes: 0.02; Carcharhiniformes: 0.02). A cross-validation experiment confirms that the model is accurate, explains a substantial portion of variance (32\%–67\%), but generates standard errors that are somewhat too small. Predictive intervals are tighter for species than for higher-level organizations (e.g. families), and predictions (including intervals) are available for all fishes worldwide in R package FishLife. I conclude by outlining how multivariate predictions of life-history and stock-recruit parameters could be useful for stock assessment, decision theory, ensemble modelling and strategic management.},
